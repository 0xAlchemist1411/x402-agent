# x404 ATXP MCP  
AI-Powered Digital Asset Marketplace with MCP Agent

## 🚀 Project Overview  
x404 ATXP MCP is a web application built to enable creators and users to upload, browse, and manage digital assets (images, PDFs, videos, links) in a marketplace-style environment. It also integrates an intelligent MCP (“Marketplace Companion”) agent powered by AI to assist with asset management, discovery, and user engagement.

From the homepage:  
> “Upload Assets – Images, PDF, Videos, Links”  

This suggests the core focus: handling different asset types and enabling their upload and categorisation.
